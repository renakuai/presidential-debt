# d3-presidential-debt
Visualizing debt by president
=======

A project that uses D3's force simulation physics and React's rendering to create a bubble chart that represents debt created by each US President.

I try to use D3 for calculations only and React for rendering; however, it was quite challenging to do for this project due having to figure out how to copy states into the force simulation and have React map through the copied nodes.
